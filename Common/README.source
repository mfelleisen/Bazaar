## Common 

This component represents the common ontology of Bazaar players and the Bazaar gaming framework. 

The `player-interface` module serves as a facade interface for the entire module.
It `provide`s a class signature for the referee to call on players, and it
`provide`s access to all public building blocks needed to understand this
building block, including the JSON messaging between the referee on the server
and remote players on distant computers.
